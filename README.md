# React Native: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  The error typically manifests as a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` or similar when using methods like `.map()` on an undefined array. This often happens during asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version, illustrating how to handle asynchronous operations and properly manage state updates to prevent this issue.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to start the app.
4. Observe the error in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves using the appropriate conditional checks and lifecycle methods to ensure the state is initialized before use.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates this best practice.
