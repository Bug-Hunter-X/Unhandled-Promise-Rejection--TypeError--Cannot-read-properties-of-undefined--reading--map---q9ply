This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is common in asynchronous operations where the state update might not be immediate.  For example, if you're fetching data from an API and trying to display it before the `useEffect` hook has finished fetching, you'll encounter this problem. The specific error message can vary depending on the context, but it generally indicates that the value you are accessing is undefined or null.
